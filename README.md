It conatins opnet modeler version 17, modified process models, which were implemented in the following paper:
  "GPSIH: A Generic IP-Based Scheme For Identity Hiding In Manets."
  The paper available on: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7036717
  
  The modified process models are located in manet station node model, the original process model named arp.
  First process model is modifed arp process model, which encrypts ip address with symmetric cipher (DES).
  Second process model is modifed arp process model, which simulates impersonation attack done by manet station.
  
  
  Instructions to use opnet modeler:
  1)You must have visual studio commpiler.
  2)You must set your enviroment variables, according to windows version you had.
  3)You must specify transmission range in your pipeline file.
